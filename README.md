# H2 Math Mini Quizzes
# A website that allows students to test their H2 Math knowledge with simple mini quizes that calculates their scores and follow up with a leaderboard. A forum page is available for all to discuss their math problems.
# What inspired me to make this is because H2 Math is a difficult subject and I would like to help other students by providing a platform where they can discuss about Math problems and help each other. I also created mini quizzes for some chapters to test their abilities where a leaderboard will then show their score and ranking. This provides a fun and gamified opportunity for everyone to learn Math and practice.
# I faced many challenges while doing this project. I am not familiar with SQL database and I spent very long figuring out how to connect them. However, with the aid of google, notes, and ChatGPT. I managed to find out how to implement it. I learnt a lot on them.
# I am proud of my website designing as I spent very long perfecting it. I am also proud of completing the project because I am not very strong at HTML coding, so finishing this was extremely demanding but I pulled through all the challenges and perservered till the end.
